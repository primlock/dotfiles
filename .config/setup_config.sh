# Setup Script for Dotfiles Dependencies
#
# Description:
#   This script installs all required dependencies for the dotfiles environment
#   It is intended only for Ubuntu and Debian-based systems
#
#   The script performs the following steps:
#     1. Verifies the system is Ubuntu/Debian (checks /etc/debian_version)
#     2. Defines a list of core dependencies
#     3. Checks if each dependency is already installed
#     4. Installs any missing packages using apt
#     5. Displays clear, color-coded status messages for each step
#
#   Re-running this script is safe; already installed packages will be skipped
#
# Usage:
#   1. Make the script executable:
#        chmod +x config_setup.sh
#
#   2. Run the script normally:
#        ./config_setup.sh
#
#   3. (Optional) Run in dry-run mode to preview what would be installed:
#        ./config_setup.sh --dry-run
#
#   4. (Optional) Run with sudo privileges upfront to avoid multiple password prompts:
#        sudo ./config_setup.sh#
#
# Notes:
#   - This script must be run on a Debian or Ubuntu system with an internet connection
#   - It uses `apt update` and `apt install` internally
#   - Root privileges are required for package installation
#   - The `--dry-run` flag will not install or modify anything; it only lists missing dependencies

# Exit immediately on errors or unset variables
set -euo pipefail
